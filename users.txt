Requirements:

	- Need database to store users
	- Need means to register a user
	- Need means to verify a user exists and their information is correct
	- Need to do something for users to do
	- Need a way to safely store user data


Considerations:

	- No code in the browser - use node for serverside verification
		- User can modify code in the browser so it's not safe
	- Hashing alone not enough - must be salted
	- Number of registration attempts must be controlled - can't spam loads of passwords


Tools:

	- OAuth2?
		- Quite complex
	- Stanford Javascript Cryto Library


Process:
	- User enters username and password
	- Username and password are sent to the server
	- Server uses username to look up password in database
	- Server hashes provided password
	- If db password is equal to provided password then user is authenticated
